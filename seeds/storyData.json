For my Business Plan Personnel Section assignment, I focused on the wrong thing - to bring in all employee names and department names dynamically into a prompt. In turn, I learned the hard way what callback hell was without the use of async and await. If I could redo this assignment, I would not focus on bringing in items dynamically and use questions in prompts utilizing existing manager_id and position_id."
